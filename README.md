Bike Parking
======
 A webapp that shows directions to the nearest bike parking in San Francisco
 See it in action here: [bikeparking.mattbutterfield.com](http://bikeparking.mattbutterfield.com)

**Setup**
Install Python dependencies.  I recommend using [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then point a browser to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) And you are ready to go!
